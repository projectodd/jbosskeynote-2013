Adjust RAILS_ROOT/data/auctions.yml to seed the database with auctions
as there is *no* UI for adding/removing auction details.

Assuming you have TorqueBox installed:

  jruby -S bundle install
  jruby -S rake db:setup

Deploy:

  torquebox deploy

And run JBoss:

  $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh

    XOR

  torquebox run

Currently developing this app against a built-from-source version of TorqueBox.
